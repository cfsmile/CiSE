  Org-mode is a simple markup language for hierarchical plain text
  file containing data, code and prose.  An entire research project
  can live in a single Org-mode file.  Org-mode provides support for
  initial note taking, planning and task managment, for embedded code
  and data which can be executed from within the document, and for
  export to a number of backends for sharing intermediate results and
  for publishing journal-quality articles.

  This article will include overview of key features, example, and
  discussion.
